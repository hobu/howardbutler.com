The Proj. 4 library and its many language ports provides the coordinate system math implementation that underlies most of the FOSS4G software ecosystem. The original author of Proj. 4, Gerald Evenden of USGS, who first published the library in 1983, recently passed in April of 2016. After a long release hiatus, the library has gained new maintainer, the user-contributed proj4.org website recently modernized the documentation management for the project, and the first significant library feature was added to support coordinate transformation pipelines. In this talk we will discuss Gerald's software legacy with Proj. 4, describe how the library has evolved through the years, and demonstrate recently added capabilities.
