[Sean Gillies](https://sgillies.net/) and Howard Butler presented a workshop at OSGIS '05 about how to use Python and Open Source software to do geospatial stuff. A number of Python geospatial libraries and tools such as Shapely and Fiona from Sean and the GDAL "next gen" Python bindings from Howard followed this workshop when it became clear there was an audience and need for the tools.
